/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"

// Ans: variable 'pet' is of type String




/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?

// Ans: 'petName' is of type 'String?', which is also considered an optional string




/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */


//Ans: nil




/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */

petName = "Fido"

//Ans: 'petName' is still of type 'String? after being assigned a value'

/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */

print(petName)

//Ans: Optional("Fido")




/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */

if petName != nil {
    print(petName)
} else {
    print("There is no pet name.")
}



/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */

if let petName = petName {
    print("My pet's name is \(petName)")
}


/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?

if anotherPetName == nil {
    "The value of anotherPetName is nil"
}

/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
*/
if let anotherPetName = anotherPetName {
    print(anotherPetName)
} else {
    print("anotherPetName has no value")
}

//Ans: expecting that anotherPetName will be 'nil'

/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */

let dinner: String?
dinner = "soup and salad"

//Ans: a constant optional may be given an initial value after it is declared.




/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
let breakfast: String?
breakfast = nil
//breakfast = "smoothie"

//Ans: once a constant optional has been assigned a value for the first time, it cannot be changed.  An error will appear if you try.
