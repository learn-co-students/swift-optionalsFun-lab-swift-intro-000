/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"


// string



/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?


// optional string



/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */


// value nil





/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
// write your code here


if let friendsPet = petName {
    print("My friend's pet is \(friendsPet)")
    print("petName is still an Optional! \(petName)")
}




/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

// prints "petName is still an Optional! Optional("Scooter")"





/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

if petName != nil {
    print ("My friend's pet is \(petName)")
} else {
    print("My friend doesn't have a pet :(")
}







/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
// write your code here


if let petName = petName {
    print("My friend's pet is \(petName)")
}




/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?
// write your code here


if anotherPetName != nil {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is \(anotherPetName)")
} else {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is nil")
}




/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

if let name = anotherPetName {
    print(name)
} else {
   print("anotherPetName has no value")
}







/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
// write your code here

let myPetName: String?
myPetName = "Fluffy"
print(myPetName)







/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
// write your code here

let otherPet: String? = nil
otherPet = "Beebo"
// There is an error.
