/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"

//the variable pet is of type String.






/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?

// the variable petName is of type Optional String or String?





/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */
// The value of petName is nil.






/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
petName = "Lister"


// The type of petName is still String? or Optional String




/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
print(petName)


// I expect to see the pet name.




/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
if petName != nil {
    print(petName)
} else {
    print("There is no pet name.")
}


// I exepct to see Optional(Lister)



/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
if let petName = petName {
    print(petName)
}







/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?

if anotherPetName == nil {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is nil!")
}







/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
if let anotherPetName = anotherPetName {
    print(anotherPetName)
} else {
    print("anotherPetName has no value")
}









/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
let name: String?

name = "Lister"

print(name)









/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
let anotherName: String? = nil

// anotherName = "Rimmer"

// The compiler comes up with an error saying that you cannot assign to value 'anotherName' is a 'let' constant.
