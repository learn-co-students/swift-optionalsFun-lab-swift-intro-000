/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"

//the type of the variable is String






/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?

//the pet name declared above is an optional string






/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */

//nill






/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */

petName = "Simba"

//it is still an optional string as we have not unwrapped it yet







/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
print(petName)

//expect to see optional("Simba") as it is unwrapped




/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */

if petName != nil {
    print(petName)
} else {
    print("I don't have a pet")
}
// since we gave pet name a value of Simba, it displays Optional("Simba")


/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */

if let petName = petName {
    print(petName)
}



/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?

if anotherPetName == nil {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is nil")
}


/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */

if let name = anotherPetName {
    print(name)
} else {
    print("anotherPetName has no value")
}




/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */

let fruit: String?
fruit = "apple"
print(fruit)

//prints out optional("apple")


/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */

let book: String? = nil

//book = "da vinci code"


//an error is given
