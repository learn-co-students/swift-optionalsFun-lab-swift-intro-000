/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"
//pet is a string





/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?
//petName is a String Optional





/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */

//value is currently 'nil'





/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
// write your code here

petName = pet

//petName is still an optional because it can be assigned a value of nil as below. Whereas 'pet' throws an error when assigned nil

petName = nil

petName = "Frankie üê∂"

/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

print (petName)



/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here


if let petName = petName { print (petName) }
else { print ("There is no pet name")}



/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
// write your code here

print (petName!)





/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?
// write your code here

if let n = anotherPetName {print (n)}
else {print ("The value of anotherPetName is nil")}





/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

if anotherPetName == nil { print ("anotherPetName has no value") }
else { print (anotherPetName!) }







/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
// write your code here

let middleName: String?

middleName = "Russel"

print (middleName)

//has the optional text

print (middleName!)

// wait so if it's an optional i can assign it values even though it's a constant?

middleName = "Antigony"

// how about

middleName = nil  // okay so then what's the point of let here... ?

/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
// write your code here

let goodCop: String? = nil

goodCop = "Gerson" // it's an error!
