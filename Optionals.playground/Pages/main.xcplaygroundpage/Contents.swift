/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `pet` declared below?
 */
var pet = "turtle üê¢"

print(pet)
print(type(of: pet))





/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below?
 */
var petName: String?






/*: question3
 ### 3. Currently, what is the _value_ of `petName`?
 */

print(petName)





/*: question4
 ### 4. Give `petName` a value! Assign to it any string. What is its type now?
 */
// write your code here

petName = "Lili"
print(petName)
print(type(of: petName))





/*: question5
 ### 5. Print out `petName` using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here







/*: question6
 ### 6. Write an if statement that only prints `petName`'s value if it is not `nil`. If `petName` is `nil`, print, "There is no pet name." What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

if let petName = petName {
    print(petName)
}

if petName == nil {
    print("there is no pet name")
}







/*: question7
 ### 7. Use _optional binding_ to unwrap the value of `petName` and print it to the console without all the **Optional(...)** stuff around it.
 */
// write your code here

// as above





/*: question8
 ### 8. Write an if statement that will print out "The value of anotherPetName is nil" using the variable below
 */
var anotherPetName: String?
// write your code here

if anotherPetName == nil {
    print("The value of anotherPetName is nil")
}






/*: question9
 ### 9. Using optional binding, write an if statement that prints "anotherPetName has no value" if it is `nil`; otherwise, print the _unwrapped_ value of `anotherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

//anotherPetName = "Fred"

if let anotherPetName = anotherPetName {
    print(anotherPetName)
} else {
    print("anotherPetName has no value **")
}









/*: question10
 ### 10. Declare a _constant_ optional string (using the `let` keyword). Then try to assign a string value to it on the next line. Print out the constant. What happens?
 */
// write your code here


let myOptional: String?
myOptional = "Erin"
print(myOptional)





/*: question11
 ### 11. Declare another _constant_ optional string, and set it to `nil` immediately. Then, on the next line, assign a string value to it. What happens?
 */
// write your code here

let myOptional2: String?
myOptional2 = nil
print(myOptional2)
//myOptional2 = "Hello"
